# Data-vizualization
This repository contains two set of codes:
1. Arduino_SensorCode
2. Data_vizualization

The first one has the .ino codes for an Arduino which collects presure sensor data (analogRead()) and saves it to a SD Card (Feather Board).

The second one has the .pde (Processing 3.0 - Java) and respective applications which runs on the PC for visualizing the data over time which was saved in the SD card by the Feather (.csv format).
